# MCP Server Rememberizer

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/mcp-rememberizer-my-first-ck)](https://smithery.ai/server/mcp-rememberizer-my-first-ck)

A [Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) server for interacting with Rememberizer's document and knowledge management API. This server enables Large Language Models to search, retrieve, and manage documents and integrations through Rememberizer.

Please note that `mcp-rememberizer-my-first-ck` is currently in development and the functionality may be subject to change.

## Components

### Resources

The server provides access to two types of resources: Documents or Slack discussions

### Tools

1. `retrieve_semantically_similar_internal_knowledge`

    - Send a block of text and retrieve cosine similar matches from your connected Rememberizer personal/team internal knowledge and memory repository
    - Input:
        - `match_this` (string): Up to a 400-word sentence for which you wish to find semantically similar chunks of knowledge
        - `n_results` (integer, optional): Number of semantically similar chunks of text to return. Use 'n_results=3' for up to 5, and 'n_results=10' for more information
        - `from_datetime_ISO8601` (string, optional): Start date in ISO 8601 format with timezone (e.g., 2023-01-01T00:00:00Z). Use this to filter results from a specific date
        - `to_datetime_ISO8601` (string, optional): End date in ISO 8601 format with timezone (e.g., 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z). Use this to filter results until a specific date
    - Returns: Search results as text output

2. `smart_search_internal_knowledge`

    - Search for documents in Rememberizer in its personal/team internal knowledge and memory repository using a simple query that returns the results of an agentic search. The search may include sources such as Slack discussions, Gmail, Dropbox documents, Google Drive documents, and uploaded files
    - Input:
        - `query` (string): Up to a 400-word sentence for which you wish to find semantically similar chunks of knowledge
        - `user_context` (string, optional): The additional context for the query. You might need to summarize the conversation up to this point for better context-awared results
        - `n_results` (integer, optional): Number of semantically similar chunks of text to return. Use 'n_results=3' for up to 5, and 'n_results=10' for more information
        - `from_datetime_ISO8601` (string, optional): Start date in ISO 8601 format with timezone (e.g., 2023-01-01T00:00:00Z). Use this to filter results from a specific date

    - Returns: Search results as text output

3. `list_internal_knowledge_systems`

    - List the sources of personal/team internal knowledge. These may include Slack discussions, Gmail, Dropbox documents, Google Drive documents, and uploaded files
    - Input: None required
    - Returns: List of available integrations

4. `rememberizer_account_information`

    - Returns: List of documents

6. `remember_this`

    - Save a piece of text information in your Rememberizer.ai knowledge system so that it may be recalled in future through tools retrieve_semantically_similar_internal_knowledge or smart_search_internal_knowledge
    - Input:
        - `name` (string): Name of the information. This is used to identify the information in the future
